    "Nxf1 encodes a protein recruited to RNPs during nucleocytoplasmic transport. It has previously been demonstrated that for 6 of 7 target genes with a particular kind of retrotransposon in an intron, the Nxf1 allele was strongly correlated with the level of target gene expression.  Specifically, the “C” allele of Nxf1 allowed a higher level of target gene RNA expression than the “B” allele (no difference was detected in the 7th gene) with ~2x effect size.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The research question is whether expression of an 8th gene that has the same class of retrotransposon in an intron is Nxf1-dependent like the majority of the others.  The tables downloaded in class (B6.txt and balbF2.txt) contain relative gene expression values from two different RT-qPCR experiments on different sets of animals. Both experiments are measuring the same (8th) gene, which has the retrotransposon inserted into an intron, just like the previously reported gene. The samples are NOT explicitly paired.\n",
