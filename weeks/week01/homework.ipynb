    "### Logging in off-campus\n",
    "\n",
    "For some reason TSCC isn't letting some people log on off-campus. To do that, you'll need to set up a VPN client following [these](https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/network/connections/off-campus/VPN/index.html) instructions for the **VPN AnyConnect client**. Don't do EasyConnect because that will only send the traffic in your browser through UCSD, but you need all of the internetz through UCSD to be able to `ssh` and stuff.\n",

    "### Can't log on to gitter\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Safari on a Mac, then there's a [bug](https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/663#issuecomment-62459096) with the GitHub login for Gitter. Copy/paste the url into a different browser. If that doesn't work, right click the \"sign in\" link and paste into a different browser. If that doesn't work, set the other browser as the default and THEN click the link. Phew! Hopefully one of those works...\n",
